# Parking Management System – Prague Parking

## Summary

This project involved creating a parking management system for Prague’s parking facility with a capacity of 100 vehicles. The system handles both cars and motorcycles (with two motorcycles able to share a single parking space).

I developed two versions:  
- **Version 1.0:** Basic functionality  
- **Version 1.1:** Added input validation, a visual parking overview with color coding, and automatic timestamping  

The project resulted in a fully functional console application.

## Features

- Manages cars and motorcycles efficiently  
- Allows two motorcycles to share a single parking space  
- Input validation to prevent errors  
- Visual overview of parking spaces using color coding  
- Automatic timestamping of parked vehicles  

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C#  
- **Application Type:** Console application  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
